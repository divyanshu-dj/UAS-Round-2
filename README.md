Image mosaicing is an effective means of constructing a single seamless image by aligning
multiple partially overlapped images. Over the years, the research attention on mosaicing has
increased a lot due to the growing applications and subsequently, many algorithms related to
mosaicing and its contributing steps have come into existence. It is widely used in creating 3D
images, medical imaging, computer vision, data from satellites, and military automatic target
recognition and even in making maps from aerial images taken by drones (often referred to as
Map Stitching).
